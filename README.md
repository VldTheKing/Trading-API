Stock Trading Simulation in Python

Explore the world of stock trading with this Python project that simulates a basic trading strategy using historical data. The simulation focuses on a stock that the user picks, employing a moving average crossover strategy. Visualizations are provided to help analyze trading signals and track portfolio performance over time.

Key Features

Data Fetching: Retrieve historical stock data from a CSV file for simulation.
Trading Strategy: Implement a straightforward moving average crossover strategy to generate buy and sell signals.
Portfolio Simulation: Simulate buying and selling actions based on trading signals, updating the virtual portfolio and balance accordingly.
Performance Tracking: Track and visualize the simulated portfolio value over the duration of the simulation.
